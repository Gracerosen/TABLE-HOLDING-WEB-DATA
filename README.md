# TABLE-HOLDING-WEB-DATA
THIS IS FOR WEB DATA THAT COULD AUTO UPDATE WITH BACK END SCRIPTS RUNNING - BUT THIS IS ONLY THE FRONT  END TABLE STRUCTURE IN HTML WITH SOME STYLES BUT MAINLY HTML TABLE STRUCTURES.


Styling with CSS - Tables, by default, are very bland. 

As a Web developer I can use CSS to style the HTML content / CSS to style tables. 

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
The code shows just some of the various table aspects you can style using CSS properties.

.css file containing instructions for styling the HTML content in the index.html file.

In style.css, can set the font-size of all table headings (th) and table data (td) to 18 pixels (18px). The th, td selector already exists for you in style.css.

Navigate to the section of the CSS that looks like this:

th, td {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: left;
  width: 33.3333%;
}
Add the following line somewhere between those two curly brackets ({}):

 font-size: 18px;
